# Project introduction
The basic introduction of the project can be filled in here, example: 
This project is based on 51 single chip microcomputer temperature and humidity alarm, with temperature and humidity detection and alarm function
(Here is an example, please delete the description after filling in)

# Project function
The related functions and application scenarios of the project can be filled in here. Example:
This design is based on the STC89C51/52 single chip microcomputer design of temperature and humidity alarm system; There are four independent buttons, the functions are set, add, decrease and determine, which can realize the adjustment of the alarm threshold. When the temperature or humidity exceeds the threshold range, there is an alarm prompt sound and the corresponding alarm light prompt.
# Project Parameters
The relevant functional parameters of the project can be filled in here, for example:
* This design uses AT24C02 memory chip, which can still save the set alarm threshold in the case of power failure; 
* This design uses LCD1602 LCD display, the top row shows the current temperature and humidity, the bottom row shows the corresponding cold, hot, dry, wet; 
* Full digital temperature and humidity sensor DHT11, with a wide temperature measurement range, can meet the general needs; 
* When the temperature or humidity exceeds the threshold range, there is a buzzer alarm prompt, and the corresponding LED alarm light is lit;

# Principle analysis (Hardware description)
The design principle of the project can be filled in here, and the design principle can be divided and analyzed. Example: 
This project consists of the following parts: the power supply part, the LED lighting part, the main control part, and the speech recognition expansion part. This project is mainly to receive and process the speech signal through the microphone, extract the human voice for analysis and comparison, and carry out the corresponding control operation when the voice is in line with the instructions.
